# Enhanced Bill Details - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

We have successfully enhanced the `BillDetails.tsx` component to provide sophisticated expense management functionality inspired by your Google Sheet workflow. The new implementation provides a comprehensive, intuitive interface for managing shared expenses with item-level detail and payment tracking.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Item-Level Detail Management**

- ✅ **Flexible Split Methods**: Equal split, percentage-based, or custom amounts per item

### 2. **Payment Status Tracking**
- ✅ **"Đã Thanh Toán" Status**: Individual items can be marked as paid by specific users

### 6. **Improved Layout & UX**
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between normal items and adjustments
- ✅ **Color Coding**: Different background colors for different sections and statuses
- ✅ **Export Preparedness**: Buttons for "Copy as Image" and "Export PDF" (ready for future implementation)

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Participant {
  id: string;
  displayName: string;
  isPayer: boolean;
  order: number;
  accountNumber?: string;
  bankCode?: string;
  accountHolder?: string;
  qrUrl?: string;

  fee?: number;
  splitMethod: "EQUAL" | "PERCENT" | "CUSTOM";
  type: "NORMAL" | "CARRY_OVER" | "SPECIAL";
  order: number;
  shares: ItemShare[];
}

interface ItemShare {
  participantId: string;
  include: boolean;    // Checkbox - whether person buys this item
  locked: boolean;     // Lock icon - prevents auto-calculation  
  paid: boolean;       // "Đã Thanh Toán" status
  rawInput?: string;   // User-entered amount or percentage
  amount: number;      // Calculated or entered amount
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
