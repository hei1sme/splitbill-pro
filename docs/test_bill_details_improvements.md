# Bill Details Improvements Test Plan

## ✅ Improvements Implemented:

### 1. **Item Removal Functionality**
- ✅ Added Trash2 icon button to each item row
- ✅ Connected to existing DELETE API endpoint `/api/bills/{id}/items/{itemId}`
- ✅ Shows confirmation and refreshes data after deletion
- **Test**: Click trash icon on any item → should delete and refresh

### 2. **Compact Payment Information**
- ✅ Reduced payer card avatar size (16 → 12)
- ✅ Smaller fonts and padding throughout sidebar
- ✅ Compact QR code display (24 → 16)
- ✅ Reduced spacing between sections
- **Test**: Sidebar should take up significantly less vertical space

### 3. **Enhanced Participant Management**
- ✅ Smart search with dropdown showing matching people
- ✅ "Add person" button when no matches found
- ✅ Real-time filtering as you type
- ✅ Visual indication of already-added participants
- **Test**: 
  - Type "N" → should show people starting with N
  - Type "Nice" → should show "+ Add Nice" if not found
  - Already selected people should show "Added" badge

### 4. **Payer Position Management**
- ✅ Payer automatically moved to end when adding participants
- ✅ Payer cannot be removed (shows error message)
- ✅ Payer marked with "PAYER" badge in participant list
- **Test**: Add any participant → payer should appear last in list

### 5. **Auto-Percentage Calculation**
- ✅ When adding participants, percentages auto-distribute equally
- ✅ When changing one percentage, others auto-adjust to fill remaining
- ✅ Real-time total percentage display with color coding
- ✅ Green when total = 100%, red when ≠ 100%
- **Test**: 
  - Add 3 people → should get 33%, 33%, 34% automatically
  - Change first person to 50% → others should become 25% each
  - Total should always be highlighted in green/red

## 🎯 Test Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Item Management
1. Go to any bill with items
2. Click trash icon on an item
3. Verify item is deleted and page refreshes

### Scenario 2: Search & Add Participants  
1. Go to Participants tab
2. Type "N" in search box
3. Verify dropdown shows people with names starting with "N"
4. Type "Nice" (assuming this person doesn't exist)
5. Verify "+ Add Nice" button appears
6. Select a real person from dropdown
7. Verify they're added to participant list

### Scenario 3: Percentage Auto-Calculation
1. Add 3 participants
2. Verify percentages are distributed (33%, 33%, 34%)
3. Change first percentage to 60%
4. Verify others become 20% each
5. Verify total shows 100% in green

### Scenario 4: Payer Management
1. Add several participants
2. Verify payer always appears last in list
3. Try to remove payer
4. Verify error message appears

### Scenario 5: Compact Sidebar
1. Compare sidebar height before/after
2. Verify QR code, avatar, and text are smaller
3. Verify all information still readable

## 🐛 Known Limitations:
- "Add person" button shows success message but doesn't actually create person (would need person creation API)
- Percentage changes don't persist to database (would need split update API)
- Legacy manual/group mode kept for backward compatibility
